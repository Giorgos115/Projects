For my undergraduate Thesis, I created four portfolios based on 36 (in total) assets. More specifically, i included:
• 10 Stocks indices
• 5 Bonds
• 10 Commodity indices
• 10 Forex rates
• 1 Real Estate index
Monthly returns of the above-mentioned 36 assets have been used, ranging from
1/1/1990-1/12/2018. Consequently, the dataset includes 348 observations- 24 per
asset.
I thereby constructed four portfolios. Each portfolio included the fifteen
traditional assets. Yet, the three latter portfolios also contained an extra
alternative asset. To fix ideas, the portfolios are:
❖ Portfolio one: Stocks and Bonds.(10 stock indices, 5 bonds)
❖ Portfolio two: Stocks Bonds and Commodities.(10 stock indices, 5 bonds,
10 commodity indices)
❖ Portfolio three: Stocks Bonds and Forex.(10 stock indices, 5 bonds, 10
forex rates)
❖ Portfolio four: Stocks Bonds and Real Estate.(10 stock indices, 5 bonds,
1 real estate index)
In the first part of the empirical application, I compared the efficient
frontier of the traditional portfolio(portfolio one) with each of the other
three portfolios. In the second part, I analyzed the backtesting results.
